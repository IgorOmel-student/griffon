[[_mvc_mvcmanager]]
= The MVCGroupManager

This class is responsible for holding the configuration of all MVC groups no matter
how they were defined, which can be either in `Config.groovy` or in an <<_addon, addon>> descriptor.

During the startup sequence an instance of `{link_mvc_group_manager}` will be created
and initialized. Later the application will instruct this instance to create all startup
groups as required. `MVCGroupManager` has a handful set of methods that deal with
MVC group configuration alone; however those that deal with group instantiation come
in 3 versions, with 2 flavors each (one Groovy, the other Java friendly).

Locating a group configuration is easily done by specifying the name you're interested in finding:

[source,groovy,options="nowrap"]
----
MVCGroupConfiguration configuration = application.mvcGroupManager.findConfiguration('foo')
----

Once you have a configuration reference you can instantiate a group with it by calling
any of the variants of the `create` method:

[source,groovy,options="nowrap"]
----
MVCGroupConfiguration configuration = application.mvcGroupManager.findConfiguration('foo')
MVCGroup group1 = configuration.create('foo1')
MVCGroup group2 = configuration.create('foo2', [someKey: 'someValue'])
// the following will make the group's id match its name
MVCGroup group3 = configuration.create()
MVCGroup group4 = configuration.create(someKey: 'someValue')
----

Be aware that creating groups with the same name is usually not a good idea. The
default `MVCGroupManager` will complain when this happens and will automatically spit
out an exception. This behavior may be changed by setting a configuration key in `Config.groovy`:

[source,groovy,options="nowrap"]
----
griffon.mvcid.collision = 'warning' // accepted values are 'warning', 'exception' (default)
----

The manager will log a warning and destroy the previously existing group before instantiating
the new one when 'warning' is the preferred strategy.

Now, even though you can create group instances based on their configurations, the preferred
way is to call any of `{link_mvc_group_manager_create_mvc}`,
`{link_mvc_group_manager_create_mvc_group}`, `{link_mvc_group_manager_with_mvc_group}` or
`{link_mvc_group_manager_with_mvc}` methods. Any class annotated with the
<<_mvc_mvcaware_transformation,@griffon.transform.MVCAware>> will also gain access to these methods.

Groups will be available by id regardless of how they were instantiated. You can ask
the `MVCGroupManager` for a particular group at any time, for example:

[source,groovy,options="nowrap"]
----
def g1 = application.mvcGroupManager.groups.foo1
def g2 = application.mvcGroupManager.findGroup('foo1')
def g3 = application.mvcGroupManager.foo1
assert g1 == g2
assert g1 == g3
----

It's also possible to query all models, views, controllers and builders on their own.
Say you'd want to inspect all currently instantiated models; this is how it can be done:

[source,groovy,options="nowrap"]
----
application.mvcGroupManager.models.each { model ->
    // do something with model
}
----
