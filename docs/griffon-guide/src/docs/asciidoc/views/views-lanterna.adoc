[[_views_lanterna]]
= Lanterna Specific

{link_lanterna} is a Java library allowing you to easily write semi-graphical user interfaces
in a text-only environment, very similar to the C library curses, but with more
functionality. Lanterna supports xterm compatible terminals and terminal emulators
such as konsole, gnome-terminal, putty, xterm and many more. One of the main benefits
of lanterna is that it's not dependent on any native library, but runs 100% in pure Java.

Lanterna 2 is not binary compatible with Lanterna 3.

Refer to the <<_builder_nodes_lanterna,list of nodes>> which become available when
the `griffon-lanterna-groovy-{griffon-version}.jar` is added as a dependency.
