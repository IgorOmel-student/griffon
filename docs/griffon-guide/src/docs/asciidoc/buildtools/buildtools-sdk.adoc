From http://sdkman.io/[SDKMAN's] website

SDKMAN can be used to install and keep up to date other build tools that make your life
easier when developing Griffon projects. These tools are `lazybones` and `gradle`.
Installing SDKMAN itself is as easy as typing the following on a command prompt:

[source]
----
$ curl -s http://get.sdkman.io | bash
----

Next, install the latest versions of `lazybones` and `gradle` by invoking

[source]
----
$ sdk install lazybones
$ sdk install gradle
----

SDKMAN works on POSIX compliant environments, even on Windows if https://www.cygwin.com/[Cygwin]
is installed. We recommend you to install http://babun.github.io/[Babun shell] as it enables
many more features than plain Cygwin.
