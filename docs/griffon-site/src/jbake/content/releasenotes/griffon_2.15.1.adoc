=== Compiletime

==== AST Transformations

Bug link:https://github.com/griffon/griffon/issues/303[303] prevented AST transformations from adding the `@Inject` annotation
on certain fields. This omission causes NPEs at runtime as the enhanced class would not be properly initialized.

=== Compatibility

Full binary compatibility report between Griffon 2.15.1 and 2.15.0 can be found
link:../reports/2.15.1/compatibility-report.html[here].
