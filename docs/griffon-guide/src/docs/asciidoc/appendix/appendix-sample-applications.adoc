[[_appendix_sample_applications]]
= Sample Applications
:numbered:

This appendix showcases the same application implemented with different languages
and different UI toolkits. The application presents a very simple form where a user
is asked for his or her name. Once a button is clicked a reply will appear within
the same window. In order to achieve this, Models hold 2 observable properties: the
first to keep track of the `input`, the second to do the same for the `output`.
Views are only concerned with values coming from the model and as such never
interact directly with Controllers. Controllers in turn only interact with Models
and a Service used to transform the input value into the output value. The single
controller action observes the rules for invoking computations outside of the UI
thread and updating UI components inside the UI thread.

These are some screenshots of each of the applications we'll cover next.

The goal of these applications is to showcase the similarities and differences of each
of them given their implementation language and UI toolkit.

[[_sample_swing]]
== Swing

Let's begin with Swing, as it's probably the most well known Java UI toolkit. First
we'll show the Java version of an artifact, then we'll show its Groovy counterpart.

[[_sample_swing_model]]
=== Model

Instances of `{link_griffon_model}` implement the `{link_observable}` interface which
means they know how to handle observable properties out of the box. We only need to be
concerned about triggering a `java.beans.PropertyChangeEvent` when a property changes value.

.sample-swing-java/griffon-app/models/sample/swing/java/SampleModel.java
[source,java,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{sample-swing-java}/griffon-app/models/sample/swing/java/SampleModel.java[lines=18..-1]
----
<1> Define a private field for the property
<2> Property accessor
<3> Property mutator must fire a `PropertyChangeEvent`

The code is quite straightforward; there's nothing much to see here other than making
sure to follow the rules for creating observable properties. The Groovy version sports
a short hand thanks to the usage of the @Observable AST transformation.

One key difference between the Java and the Groovy version is that the Groovy Model
does not extend a particular class. This is due to Griffon being aware of its own
conventions and applying the appropriate byte code manipulation (via AST transformations).
The compiled Model class does implement the `{link_griffon_model}` interface as required by
the framework. This type of byte code manipulation is expected to work for every Groovy
based artifact.

.sample-swing-groovy/griffon-app/models/sample/swing/groovy/SampleModel.groovy
[source,groovy,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{sample-swing-groovy}/griffon-app/models/sample/swing/groovy/SampleModel.groovy[lines=18..-1]
----
<1> Observable property

Properties become observable by simply annotating them with @Observable. The Groovy compiler
will generate the required boilerplate code, which just so happens to be functionally equivalent
to what we showed in the Java version.

[[_sample_swing_controller]]
=== Controller

Controllers provide actions that are used to fill up the application's interaction.
They usually manipulate values coming from Views via Model properties. Controllers may
rely on additional components, such as Services, to do they work. This is exactly our
case, as there's a `SampleService` instance injected into our controllers.

.sample-swing-java/griffon-app/controllers/sample/swing/java/SampleController.java
[source,java,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{sample-swing-java}/griffon-app/controllers/sample/swing/java/SampleController.java[lines=18..-1]
----
<1> MVC member injected by `{link_mvc_group_manager}`
<2> Injected by JSR 330
<3> Automatically run off the UI thread
<4> Get back inside the UI thread

Of particular note is the fact that actions are always executed outside of the UI thread
unless otherwise configured with an `@Threading` annotation. Once we have computed the right
output, we must inform the View of the new value. This is done by updating the model
inside the UI thread [conum,data-value=4]_4_.

.sample-swing-groovy/griffon-app/controllers/sample/swing/groovy/SampleController.groovy
[source,groovy,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{sample-swing-groovy}/griffon-app/controllers/sample/swing/groovy/SampleController.groovy[lines=18..-1]
----
<1> MVC member injected by `{link_mvc_group_manager}`
<2> Injected by JSR 330
<3> Automatically run off the UI thread
<4> Get back inside the UI thread

The Groovy version of the Controller is much terser, of course. However, there's a nice
feature available to Groovy Swing: Model properties bound to UI components are _always_
updated inside the UI thread.

[[_sample_swing_service]]
=== Service

Services are tasked to work with raw data and I/O; they should *_never_* interact with
Views and Models directly, though you may have additional components injected to them.
The following service shows another facility provide by the
`{link_griffon_application}` interface:
`{link_message_source}`, capable of resolving i18n-able
resources.

[source,groovy,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{sample-swing-groovy}/griffon-app/services/sample/swing/groovy/SampleService.groovy[lines=18..-1]
----

[[_sample_swing_view]]
=== View

We come to the final piece of the puzzle: the View. Components are arranged in a
one column vertical grid:

.sample-swing-java/griffon-app/views/sample/swing/java/SampleView.java
[source,java,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{sample-swing-java}/griffon-app/views/sample/swing/java/SampleView.java[lines=18..-1]
----
<1> MVC member injected by `{link_mvc_group_manager}`
<2> Attach window to `{link_window_manager}`
<3> Apply component-to-model binding
<4> Hook in controller action by name

Here we can appreciate at [conum,data-value=3]_3_ how Model properties are bound to
View components, and also how controller actions can be transformed into toolkit actions
that may be applied to buttons [conum,data-value=4]_4_ for example.

.sample-swing-groovy/griffon-app/views/sample/swing/groovy/SampleView.groovy
[source,groovy,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{sample-swing-groovy}/griffon-app/views/sample/swing/groovy/SampleView.groovy[lines=18..-1]
----
<1> MVC member injected by `{link_mvc_group_manager}`
<2> Create window and attach it to `{link_window_manager}`
<3> Apply component-to-model binding
<4> Hook in controller action by name

The Groovy version is again much terser thanks to the http://groovy-lang.org/dsls.html#swingbuilder[SwingBuilder DSL].
Notice how easy it is to bind [conum,data-value=3]_3_ model properties using the `bind` node.
The controller action is also transformed into a UI toolkit specific action; however,
this time it's easier to grab: by convention all controller actions are exposed as variables
to the corresponding `builder`.

[[_sample_swing_resources]]
=== Resources

The last file we'll touch is the one that holds the i18n-able content. Griffon supports
several formats. Here we're showing the standard one as found in many Java projects.

.sample-swing-java/griffon-app/i18n/messages.properties
[source,java,linenums]
----
include::{sample-swing-java}/griffon-app/i18n/messages.properties[lines=19..-1]

[[_sample_javafx]]
== JavaFX

JavaFX is a next generation UI toolkit and will eventually replace Swing, so it's a good
idea to get started with it now. Among the several features found in JavaFX you'll find

 - observable properties
 - component styling with CSS
 - FXML: a declarative format for defining UIs
 - and more!

[[_sample_javafx_model]]
=== Model

.sample-javafx-java/griffon-app/models/sample/javafx/java/SampleModel.java
[source,java,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{sample-javafx-java}/griffon-app/models/sample/javafx/java/SampleModel.java[lines=18..-1]
----
<1> Define a private field for the property
<2> Property accessor
<3> Pass-thru values to `Property`

The Model makes use of JavaFX's observable properties. These properties are roughly
equivalent in behavior to the ones we saw back in the <<_swing,Swing>> example; however,
they provide much more behavior than that; values may be cached automatically, for
example, avoiding needless updating of bindings.

.sample-javafx-groovy/griffon-app/models/sample/javafx/groovy/SampleModel.groovy
[source,groovy,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{sample-javafx-groovy}/griffon-app/models/sample/javafx/groovy/SampleModel.groovy[lines=18..-1]
----
<1> Observable property

As with `@Observable` we find that Groovy-based JavaFX models can use another AST
transformation named `@FXObservable`. This transformation generates equivalent byte code
to the Java based Model we saw earlier.

[[_sample_javafx_controller]]
=== Controller

Have a look at the controller for this application. See if you can spot the differences
from its Swing counterpart.

.sample-javafx-java/griffon-app/controllers/sample/javafx/java/SampleController.java
[source,java,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{sample-javafx-java}/griffon-app/controllers/sample/javafx/java/SampleController.java[lines=18..-1]
----
<1> MVC member injected by `{link_mvc_group_manager}`
<2> Injected by JSR 330
<3> Automatically run off the UI thread
<4> Get back inside the UI thread

Did you spot any differences? No? That's because the two controllers are 100% identical.
How can this be? This is the power of separating concerns between MVC members. Because
the Controller only talks to the View via the Model, and the Model exposes an identical
contract for its properties; we didn't have to change the Controller at all.

.sample-javafx-groovy/griffon-app/controllers/sample/javafx/groovy/SampleController.groovy
[source,groovy,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{sample-javafx-groovy}/griffon-app/controllers/sample/javafx/groovy/SampleController.groovy[lines=18..-1]
----
<1> MVC member injected by `{link_mvc_group_manager}`
<2> Injected by JSR 330
<3> Automatically run off the UI thread
<4> Get back inside the UI thread

As opposed to its Swing counterpart, here we have to add an explicit threading block when
updating model properties. This is because the `bind` node for JavaFX components is not
aware of the same rules as the `bind` node for Swing components. Nevertheless, the
code remains short and to the point.

[[_sample_javafx_service]]
=== Service

Given that the service operates with raw data and has no ties to the toolkit in use, we'd
expect no changes from the Swing example.

.sample-javafx-java/griffon-app/services/sample/javafx/java/SampleService.java
[source,java,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{sample-javafx-java}/griffon-app/services/sample/javafx/java/SampleService.java[lines=18..-1]

[source,groovy,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{sample-javafx-groovy}/griffon-app/services/sample/javafx/groovy/SampleService.groovy[lines=18..-1]
----

[[_sample_javafx_view]]
=== View

Views are the artifacts that are most impacted by the choice of UI toolkit. You may
remember we mentioned FXML as one of the strong features delivered by JavaFX, so
we chose to implement the Java-based View by reading an fxml file by convention.

.sample-javafx-java/griffon-app/views/sample/javafx/java/SampleView.java
[source,java,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{sample-javafx-java}/griffon-app/views/sample/javafx/java/SampleView.java[lines=18..-1]
----
<1> MVC member injected by `{link_mvc_group_manager}`
<2> Create window and attach it to `{link_window_manager}`
<3> Injected by FXMLLoader
<4> Hook actions by convention

`FXMLLoader` can inject components to an instance as long as that instance exposes
fields annotated with `@FXML`; fields names must match component ids [conum,data-value=2]_2_
as defined in the fxml file, which is shown next:

.sample-javafx-java/griffon-app/resources/sample/javafx/java/sample.fxml
[source,xml,linenums]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
include::{sample-javafx-java}/griffon-app/resources/sample/javafx/java/sample.fxml[]
----
<1> Naming convention for automatic action binding

Please pay special attention to the `fx:id` given to the button. Griffon applies a naming
convention to match controller actions to JavaFX components that can handle said actions.
Let's review what we have here:

 - `SampleController` exposes an action named `sayHello`
 - the button has an `fx:id` value of `sayHelloActionTarget`

Given this we infer that the `fx:id` value must be of the form `<actionName>ActionTarget`.
The naming convention is one of two steps; you must also connect the controller using
a helper method [conum,data-value=4]_4_ as shown in the View.

.sample-javafx-groovy/griffon-app/views/sample/javafx/groovy/SampleView.groovy
[source,groovy,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
include::{sample-javafx-groovy}/griffon-app/views/sample/javafx/groovy/SampleView.groovy[lines=18..-1]
----
<1> MVC member injected by `{link_mvc_group_manager}`
<2> Create window and attach it to `{link_window_manager}`
<3> Apply component-to-model binding
<4> Hook actions by convention

The Groovy version of the View uses the GroovyFX DSL instead of FXML. You'll find that
this DSL is very similar to SwingBuilder.

[[_sample_javafx_resources]]
=== Resources

Finally, the resources for this application are identical to the Swing version.

[[_sample_lanterna]]
== Lanterna

http://code.google.com/p/lanterna/[Lanterna] is a Java library allowing you to write
easy semi-graphical user interfaces in a text-only environment, very much like the
C library curses, but with more functionality. Lanterna supports xterm-compatible terminals
and terminal emulators such as konsole, gnome-terminal, putty, xterm and many more.
One of the main benefits of lanterna is that it's not dependent on any native library,
but runs 100% in pure Java.

[[_sample_lanterna_model]]
=== Model

Even though Lanterna UI components do not expose observable properties in any way,
it's a good thing to use observable properties in the Model, and so the following
Model is identical to the <<_swing,Swing>> version.

.sample-lanterna-java/griffon-app/models/sample/lanterna/java/SampleModel.java
[source,java,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----

----
<1> Define a private field for the property
<2> Property accessor
<3> Property mutator must fire a `PropertyChangeEvent`

For reasons we'll see in the Groovy View and Controller, we decided to skip a Model
for the Groovy version. This also demonstrates that even though an MVC group is the
smallest building block, you can still configure how it's assembled. Have a look at
the application's configuration to find out how:

----
include::{sample-lanterna-groovy}/griffon-app/conf/sample/lanterna/groovy/Config.groovy[lines=18..-1]
----

[[_sample_lanterna_controller]]
=== Controller

We find that for the Java version, the Controller is identical to the <<_swing,Swing>>
and <<_javafx, JavaFX>> versions. For the Groovy one we notice that both `input`
and `output` view components are accessed directly. We know we've said in the past
that a Controller should never do this, but because Lanterna exposes no bind mechanism,
the Groovy binding implementation would look as verbose as the Java version; we
decided to take a shortcut for demonstration purposes.

=== Service

Again, services should not be affected by the choice of UI tookit, so the following
Service definitions are identical to the previous ones we saw earlier.

[[_sample_lanterna_view]]
=== View

We'd expect the View to follow the same pattern we've seen in the previous examples;
that is, create two components that will be bound to model properties and a button
that's connected to a Controller action. Here we see that the Java version is rather
verbose due to the fact that Lanterna has no observable UI components. This is the
reason we must explicitly set the value of the `input` component in
the `input` Model property as soon as the button is clicked.

<1> MVC member injected by `{link_mvc_group_manager}`
<2> Create window and attach it to `{link_window_manager}`
<3> Apply component-to-model binding
<4> Hook actions by convention

Fortunately, we can rely on the observable `output` Model property to write back the
value to the `output` component as soon as said property is updated.

[[_sample_pivot]]
== Pivot

http://pivot.apache.org[Apache Pivot] is an open-source platform for building installable
Internet applications (IIAs). It combines the enhanced productivity and usability features
of a modern user interface toolkit with the robustness of the Java platform.

We decided to implement this application in the same fashion as the <<_lanterna,Lanterna>>
application for the same reason: Pivot UI components are not observable. You'll
notice that the Java Model is identical, and there's no Groovy Model.

[[_sample_pivot_controller]]
=== Controller

The Pivot Controllers follow the same rules as the Lanterna ones, and as such you'll
see there are no differences between one another.

[[_sample_pivot_view]]
=== View

If you squint, you'll see that the View is almost identical to the <<_swing,Swing>>
and <<_lanterna,Lanterna>> Views. Besides using toolkit specific components, we notice
that both `input` and `output` Model properties have to be explicitly bound using
the native support exposed by the toolkit.
