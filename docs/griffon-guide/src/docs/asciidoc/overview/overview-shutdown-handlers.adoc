= Shutdown Handlers

Applications have the option to let particular artifacts abort the shutdown sequence
and/or perform a task while the shutdown sequence is in process. Artifacts that desire
to be part of the shutdown sequence should implement the `{link_shutdown_handler}`
interface and register themselves with the application instance.

The contract of a `{link_shutdown_handler}` is very simple:

* `boolean canShutdown(GriffonApplication application)` - return *`false`* to abort the shutdown sequence.
* `void onShutdown(GriffonApplication application)` - called if the shutdown sequence was not aborted.

``{link_shutdown_handler}``s will be called on the same order as they were registered.
