= The @ResourcesAware AST Transformation

Any component may gain the ability to locate resources through a `ResourceHandler`
instance. You need only annotate the class with `{link_resources_aware}`
and it will automatically gain all methods exposed by `{link_resource_handler}`.

This feature is just a shortcut to avoid obtaining the application instance
by objects which do not hold a reference to it.

Here's an example of a custom bean which is able to locate resources:

[source,groovy,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
@griffon.transform.core.ResourcesAware
class Bean {
    String name
}
----

This class can be used in the following way:

[source,groovy,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
class SampleService {
    @Inject Bean bean

    InputStream fetchResource(String arg) {
        bean.name = arg
        bean.getResourceAsStream(bean.name)
    }
}
----
