= Typed MVCGroups

Typed MVCGroups gives you type safe access to each MVC member defined by the group. This feature assumes
the MVC group has the required `Model`, `View`, and `Controller` members; it won't work for groups that
define less than these 3 members. You may define additional typed accessors for other members too. For example

[source,java,linenums,options="nowrap"]
.src/main/java/org/example/FooMVCGroup.java
----
package org.example;

import javax.inject.Named;
import griffon.core.mvc.MVCGroup;
import org.codehaus.griffon.runtime.core.mvc.AbstractTypedMVCGroup;

@Named("foo")
public class FooMVCGroup extends AbstractTypedMVCGroup<FooModel, FooView, FooController> {
    public FooMVCGroup(MVCGroup delegate) {
        super(delegate);
    }
}
----

Instances of this group can be created as follows

[source,java,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
FooMVCGroup fooGroup1 = createMVCGroup(FooMVCGroup.class);
FooMVCGroup fooGroup2 = createMVCGroup(FooMVCGroup.class, "foo2");
----

You may now refer to the exact types of each MVC member, for example

[source,java,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
FooMVCGroup fooGroup = createMVCGroup(FooMVCGroup.class);
fooGroup.model().setSomeProperty("value"); // returned model type is FooModel

// the following won't even compile
MVCGroup mvcGroup = createMVCGroup("foo");
mvcGroup.getModel().setSomeProperty("value"); // returned model type is GriffonModel !!
----

The name of the group is determined by the value of the `@Named` annotation. If the annotation is not present
then the simple class name (`FooMVCGroup` in this case) will be used instead.
