[[_addons-addonmanager]]
= The AddonManager

The `{link_addon_manager}` is responsible for keeping track of instantiated
``{link_addon}``s. You may use this manager to query which addons have been
registered with the application, then conditionally enabling further features
if a particular addon is instantiated or not.

The name of a `{link_addon}` is used as the key to register it with the `{link_addon_manager}`,
in other words, the previous *inspector* addon can be queried in the following way:

[source,java,options="nowrap"]
----
GriffonAddon addon = application.getAddonManager().findAddon("inspector");
