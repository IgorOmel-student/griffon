= Additional Threading Methods

There are two additional methods that complement the generic threading facilities
which Griffon exposes to the application and its artifacts:

isUIThread():: Returns `true` if the current thread is the UI thread, `false` otherwise.
Functionally equivalent to calling `SwingUtilities.isEventDispatchThread()` in Swing.
runFuture(ExecutorService s, Callable c):: schedules a callable on the target `ExecutorService`.
The executor service can be left unspecified; if so, a default Thread pool executor will be used.
