= The @ThreadingAware AST Transformation

Any component may gain the ability to execute code in a particular thread, following
the selected UI toolkit's execution rules. It injects the behavior of `{link_threadinghandler}`
into the annotated class.

This feature is just a shortcut to avoid obtaining the `UIThreadManager` instance
by objects which do not hold a reference to it.

Here's an example of a custom component which is able to call its methods in different
threads:

package sample

@griffon.transform.ThreadingAware
class Sample {
    void doStuff() {
        runOutsideUI {
            // executed outside of the UI thread
        }
    }

    void moreStuff() {
        runInsideUIAsync {
            // executed asynchronously inside the UI thread
        }
    }
}
